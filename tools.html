                <p>
                    The paper I use is a <i>Fabriano Brand</i>. Their paper ranges based on the type of other materials I will work with.
                    Mostly the best <i>Fabriano</i> paper I have worked with is the <i>Bristol</i> paper. I like the smoothness of the paper
                    which makes it easier to work with when shading, which creates even tones on the surface.<br /> As an artist I still
                    have a long journey to travel, and I hope I will also test other different type of paper brands, which is what I am
                    currently planning to do.

                <p class="pencil">
                    I usually work with <i>Graphite and Charcoal</i>. I usually prefer
                    <i>Graphite</i> pencils because of their strength and also they have a wide range when working with tones.
                    They range from 9H to 10B, H being hard and creating light tones, and B being soft and creating dark tones. They do not break easily when you work
                    with them compared to charcoal pencils.<br />
                    With Charcoal I work with <i>Hard, Medium and Soft</i>, ranging from light tones to dark tones.

                <h1>Erasers</h1>
                <p>
                    Erasers are great for use especially when creating highlights. The type of erasers I use are <i>
                        Mono zero 0.5mm easer, Mono zero regular and
                        Kneadable eraser
                    </i>. <i>Mono zero 0.5mm</i> is best when when creating line like highlights, when big eraser cna not work.
                    I usually use it when creating <i>fur, white hair, pimples and etc</i><br />.
                    Kneadable eraser is ideal when creating pimples as highglights, it can change shape depending on how you want to work.<br />
                    Nothing much to say on the Mono zero regular eraser, many have worked with them in school to erase pencils mistakes they create.
                    That is where it comes in handy.

                <p>
                    When working with pencils, smoothening tones is essential to make the surface appeare more alive and realistic.
                    Hence blending is needed, to smoothen the pencil tones. Blenders I use include <i>swabs, tissue paper, cloth, blending sticks and brushes</i>
                    . Yes, brushes. Most of the time I use brushes for blending.

                <p>
                    I usually use graphite powder where pencils might take me a long time to shade. Usually when creating a background,
                    there is where graphite powder mostly essential. Work that might take me almost an hour to do using a pencil, it will
                    take me a few minutes with just a graphite powder and tissue paper.

                    I also use charcoal powder for speed, but I love it mostly because light does not reflect on the surface of charcoal after
                    shadding..

                <h1>Fixative</h1>
                <p>
                    If you have worked with a pencil before, I am sure you will agree with me that after some time it can smudge or be easily erased.
                    Hence it is best to use a fixative to bind and keep your work safe from such obstacles. No one would love a smudged work.
                    It also helps to make your work archival, meaning stay for a longer period of time without damage.
                    Depending on the brand you use, you just spray on the surface once or up to three times. It is best to read instructions before
                    working with a fixative, because some might be harmful to the lungs and might end up causing you lung can er. We would not
                    want that would we, an artist battling cancer caused by his work.

                <p>
                    It's always best to keep your pencisl sharp all the time. The sharpener I use all the time is the metal sharpener.
                    There are other great range of sharpeners to use also, which include mechanical ones, and also razor blades. I usually
                    prefer the metal sharpener because it is easier and cheaper for someone like me.
